	    	<p>One of the goals I had for this project was to apply a bunch of things that I’ve been learning about in combination. I’ve used one or more of these tools / technologies in different projects, but I’ve not had the chance to put them all together in a single project so far. These include things F#, Domain driven design (DDD), Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), Event sourcing, Xamarin, MVVMCross, Reactive Extensions framework etc.</p>

<p>In this post I’ll try to flesh out some of my thoughts around how I could put these technologies to good use in building the new cross-platform version of this mobile app.</p>

  </ul>

</div>

<p>I’m not going to explain each of these tools / frameworks / patterns here because there has been a lot said about those already. Instead, I’d like to focus on how to apply some of these things to a specific application - and hopefully this will be useful to someone (including a future me), when stuck with a problem that these technologies are designed to help with.</p>

<p>Now, to start off - I already had a set of portable class libraries written in C# that make up the current version of All About Money. As I reviewed the design of the current app, I made a few interesting observations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A lot of my service layer code is functional with heavy use of LINQ</li>
  <li>I was not separating concerns properly and was trying to re-use my persistence model (i.e. the C# classes I use to store the data to disk) - as my Domain and also DTOs (data transfer objects)</li>
  <li>I was even binding some of these objects directly to the UI (and implemented <code>INotifyPropertyChanged</code> on some of them to support MVVM!)</li>
  <li>The cross-device synchronisation logic was more complicated than it needed to be - since I was using a very simple ‘file-per-class-type’ JSON store that I wrote a while ago</li>
  <li>Some of the PCL infrastructure code purely existing due to the way OOP works</li>
  <li>I wrote a lot of my own code to do view model discovery etc</li>
  <li>I had very little to protect me from accidentally writing incorrect code that would violate invariants in the domain</li>
</ul>

<p>There were more issues - but overall it prompted me to do a full re-think on how I’d design it - since now is a good opportunity, as I’m planning to release a cross-platform version.</p>

<p>Given these problems, tools like F#, DDD, MVVMCross and Xamarin almost chose themselves.</p>

<h4 id="trying-to-apply-ddd-to-the-personal-finance-domain">Trying to apply DDD to the personal finance domain</h4>

<p>From the perspective of the domain (accounting) - personal finance seems to be no different from a regular/business accounting in the sense that the core accounting principles apply in both cases. However, the user experience and interactions may need to be simplified to use a language and interface that talks about income, expenses, savings, budgets, categorisation and so on - as opposed to credits, debits, journals, ledgers and so on.</p>

<p>Also - I just didn’t want to build yet-another-full-blown-accounting system.</p>

<p>So, I started thinking about what the main ‘business’ events may be, and the language used to describe then came up with this first attempt:</p>

<h4 id="possible-events-that-involve-money">Possible events that involve money:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>I spend money to buy something or pay for a service/fine.</li>
  <li>I earn money and deposit it into an account.</li>
  <li>I budget for a holiday and save money for it.</li>
  <li>I transfer money between my accounts.</li>
  <li>I import my bank/loan/credit card transaction statement.</li>
  <li>I lend money to help out someone.</li>
  <li>I get repaid by someone for the money I lent.</li>
  <li>I borrow money to pay for something.</li>
  <li>I pay off a loan.</li>
  <li>I buy a house / car etc.</li>
  <li>I sell a house / car.</li>
  <li>Is gifts a subset of spending/receiving?</li>
  <li>I gift money to someone.</li>
  <li>I get a gift of money from someone.</li>
</ul>

<p>This was getting me nowhere. I was discussing this with a colleague and he quickly pointed out that I had no way of knowing every possible event that happens in anyone’s life that involved money.</p>

<p>Then, I started fresh and thought about why people may want to use the app in the first place - to make sure what I’m building actually meets their needs:</p>

<h4 id="why-will-people-use-this-app">Why will people use this app?</h4>

<ul>
  <li>To find out how much money they have in their accounts</li>
  <li>To find out how much they have saved</li>
  <li>To find out how much they can afford - for a holiday/activity/something to buy/invest</li>
  <li>To find out how much they have made in different ways</li>
  <li>To find out how much they have spent in different ways</li>
  <li>To find out how much they can save</li>
  <li>To find out where they can save</li>
  <li>To plan and budget for the future period</li>
  <li>To budget save for a goal</li>
  <li>To calculate their net worth</li>
</ul>

<p>Given this, I tried to boil down the events to just what an simple accounting system:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Money is <code>withdrawn</code> from an account</li>
  <li>Money is <code>deposited</code> into an account</li>
  <li>Money is transferred between accounts</li>
  <li><code>Transactions</code> are <code>imported</code> from a <code>statement</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Each of the above transactions update the relevant account <code>balance</code>.</p>

<p>I later realised, that if I want to express these concepts from a user’s perspective, (say as actions / ‘commands’ the user may execute) these correspond to something like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I <code>spend</code> money on something</li>
  <li>I <code>receive</code> money for something</li>
  <li>I set a <code>budget</code> for a spending category</li>
  <li>I <code>import</code> a bank <code>transaction</code> <code>statement</code> into an <code>account</code></li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve highlighted all the key events / entities involved.</p>

<p>This helped me get started on a domain model for the command-side of the system. Expressed in F#, the first attempt looks like:</p>

<figure class="highlight">

</figure>

<p>This represents the core domain - with a ‘money’ type that is modelled as a unit of measure - so that I don’t accidentally do incorrect math on it by mixing it up with regular decimals. A transaction is very simple: it has a date when it happened, an amount expressed as money, a description and an optional category. Since transactions may be grouped/categorised/classified in a number of ways and these groupings don’t always conform to a proper heirarchy/structure, I’ve introduced a concept of a ‘Tag’ - where a transaction is tagged with one or more tags. Any number of transactions can be tagged with the same tag. Later, the read-side of the application can query transactions and group them by tags, categories, accounts etc. For now the only aspects of an account that we are interested in - is a name and a number and the type of currency for the account. (The intention is to support using any currency, since I have users from various countries - but a user having multiple accounts with different currencies will be interesting - something I’ll deal with later when building the app.)</p>

<p>The only entities in the above are <code>Transaction</code> and <code>Account</code>. All other types are value objects. To make sure I get the free structural equality F# gives me, and also treat a transaction as an entity with a reference, I’ve added a ‘Id’ attribute to the transaction record type. The idea is to treat two CLR references with the same attribute values (including Id) as the same transaction - if I need to compare something read from storage with a transaction in-memory. I’m thinking I won’t have a need for that since I’ll probably be using other record types / classes when reading the data vs those used in writing it to persistent storage.</p>

<p>Now, I still have to flesh it out to ensure some additional constraints are designed into the type system so that I <a href="http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/designing-with-types-making-illegal-states-unrepresentable/">can’t represent invalid states</a>.</p>

<p>Regarding the CQRS aspect of it - I’ve not yet thought about what the commands and queries will be. That’s a post in itself. I can already identify some events like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>TransactionCreated</li>
  <li>StatementImported</li>
  <li>TransactionChanged</li>
</ul>

<p>etc.</p>

<p>Though it looks very CRUD-dy, I’m not sure if there are more specific events for a simple accounting system.
I’d imagine some of these will evolve over time as I build more and more of that app - especially the queries on the read side.</p>

<p>For the storage of the data, I’m expecting that using event sourcing (with a simple JSON file store) will help me simplify state management by since I won’t ever have to change a file written to disk - if the file only contains immutable events like the ones listed above.</p>

<p>That’s how far I’ve got at the moment. I’ll share more of my design thinking and flesh it out as we go, in future posts.</p>

<p>I’d like to hear your thoughts / suggestions on what your design may look like…</p>
